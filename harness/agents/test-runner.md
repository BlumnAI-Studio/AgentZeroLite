# Test Runner

## Why this agent exists

LLM-backed smoke tests (Whisper, Gemma, Webnori) are slow — a full
`dotnet test` cycle can sit at 5+ minutes and saturate RAM with concurrent
testhosts (see `harness/knowledge/test-runner/dotnet-test-execution.md`'s 12 GB
incident). Running them after every code change is more friction than
signal. The user has therefore chosen: **tests run only when the user
asks — with one narrow exception for newly-authored tests (see
Author-verify mode below).**

This agent is the single owner of `dotnet test` invocation in the
harness. Build-doctor, test-sentinel, and the release pipeline all
delegate execution here (or skip it entirely).

## Triggers — four modes

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Scoped** | "연관된 유닛테스트 수행해" / "관련 …" / "run related unit tests" | git diff → infer changed scope → run only matching tests via `--filter` |
| **Full**   | "전체 유닛테스트 수행해" / "run all unit tests" | Full headless suite (and AgentTest if desktop session) |
| **History**| "유닛테스트 이력" / "최근 유닛테스트 이력알려줘" / "test history" | No execution — read recent `harness/logs/test-runner/*.md` and summarize |
| **Author-verify** *(auto)* | Claude authored a new test in the current task | One `--filter` run scoped to ONLY the new test class/method. LLM-smoke → ask first. |

Everything else (code changes in non-test files, refactors, fixes, builds,
releases) does NOT trigger this agent. The Author-verify mode is the only
non-user-initiated path, and it is deliberately narrow.

## Procedure — Mode "Scoped" (related tests)

Goal: quickly verify the unit tests *touching the code that changed* still pass,
without paying the full LLM-smoke-test cost.

1. Determine the change set:
   - Uncommitted: `git diff --name-only` + `git diff --cached --name-only`.
   - If the user mentions a specific commit/PR, use that range instead.
2. From changed paths, infer test scope:
   - `Project/ZeroCommon/Foo/Bar.cs` → look for tests under
     `Project/ZeroCommon.Tests/**/*Bar*` or namespace-matching classes.
   - `Project/AgentZeroWpf/**` → AgentTest project (desktop session needed).
   - If the change is doc-only (`*.md`, `Docs/**`) → report "no tests in
     scope" and exit without invoking dotnet.
3. Build the `--filter` expression. Prefer `FullyQualifiedName~Foo` over
   `FullyQualifiedName=...` so partial matches work. For multiple classes,
   join with `|` operator inside the filter.
4. Single foreground call (per `harness/knowledge/test-runner/dotnet-test-execution.md`
   R1) with the filter:
   ```bash
   dotnet test Project/ZeroCommon.Tests/ZeroCommon.Tests.csproj \
     --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ChangedClass1|FullyQualifiedName~ChangedClass2"
   ```
5. **[Required]** Before reporting, `tasklist | grep -iE "testhost|vstest"`
   must be empty (canon R6).
6. **[Required]** Write log per "Log format" below.

If scope inference is ambiguous (e.g. cross-project shared helper
changed), ask the user once which scope to run, or default to "full"
with explicit user OK.

## Procedure — Mode "Full" (all tests)

1. Headless suite — single foreground call (canon R1):
   ```bash
   dotnet test Project/ZeroCommon.Tests/ZeroCommon.Tests.csproj
   ```
2. **Optional, only when desktop session is available** —
   `Project/AgentTest/AgentTest.csproj`. Refuse in headless / CI per canon R5.
   Ask the user before invoking AgentTest if it isn't obvious from context.
3. **[Required]** `tasklist | grep -iE "testhost|vstest"` after each phase;
   kill orphans, note in log.
4. **[Required]** Write log per "Log format" below.

## Procedure — Mode "History" (no execution)

1. List `harness/logs/test-runner/` — newest 10 by filename (the
   `yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm` prefix sorts chronologically).
2. Parse each log's frontmatter (`mode`, `reason`, `result`,
   `tests_passed`, `tests_failed`, `duration_seconds`).
3. Report a tight summary:
   - When the run happened, mode, why, outcome.
   - Trends: how many full vs scoped, recent failures, last green run.
   - Any pattern worth flagging (same test failing repeatedly, scope
     inference repeatedly missing a class, etc.).
4. Do NOT invoke `dotnet test` in History mode — pure read-only.
5. **[Required]** Write a brief log under `harness/logs/test-runner/`
   marking `mode: history` so the audit trail records the query.

## Procedure — Mode "Author-verify" (auto, narrow)

Goal: when Claude authors a new unit test in the same task, prove the test
actually exercises what its name claims — without paying the full-suite
cost. A test that compiles but asserts nothing is worse than no test.

**When this mode fires.** End of a task where Claude added at least one
new `[Fact]` / `[Theory]` method or created a new test class file under
`Project/ZeroCommon.Tests/` or `Project/AgentTest/`. Pure renames, moves,
or formatting changes do NOT fire it. If only existing tests were edited
(behavior unchanged) it does NOT fire either.

**Procedure:**
1. Identify the newly-added test surface from the in-task diff:
   - New `*Tests.cs` file → filter to the class name.
   - New `[Fact]` / `[Theory]` inside an existing class → filter to
     `ClassName.MethodName` if the test is the only new addition,
     otherwise to `ClassName` (covers multiple new methods at once).
2. **LLM-smoke guard.** If the test's class or assembly touches Whisper,
   Gemma, Webnori, or any on-device LLM path (check `using` directives
   + class name), **stop and ask the user**:
   > "이 신규 테스트는 LLM-스모크에 해당해 CPU/RAM 부담이 큽니다. 지금
   > 실행할까요, 아니면 사용자 트리거 시점까지 미룰까요?"
   Honor whatever they say. Default if no answer: defer.
3. Single foreground call with the filter (canon R1):
   ```bash
   dotnet test Project/ZeroCommon.Tests/ZeroCommon.Tests.csproj \
     --filter "FullyQualifiedName~NewTestClass.NewTestMethod"
   ```
   For tests under `AgentTest`, only run if a desktop session is
   available (canon R5).
4. **[Required]** `tasklist | grep -iE "testhost|vstest"` after the run.
5. **[Required]** Write log per "Log format" below with `mode: author-verify`,
   `reason: "newly authored in task: <one-line task summary>"`, and the
   filter string. Even a pass case logs — the audit trail is the point.

**Scope discipline.** Author-verify fires at most once per task. If Claude
adds five new tests across two files in one task, run a single filtered
call covering both classes (`~ClassA|~ClassB`). Do not loop.

# {Title}

## Why this run
{User context — what change motivated this verification, or what
question the history query is answering. This is the future-improvement
mine — without "why", the log is just a number.}

## Scope
{Files / classes / projects targeted, plus the filter expression if any.}

## Result
{Headline pass/fail count, time, and any failing test names with
the assertion message snippet.}

## Notes
{Anything the next reader will care about — flaky test suspicion,
expected slowdown for LLM smoke, missing testhost cleanup, etc.}
```

## What the Runner does NOT do

- Does **not** run after `git commit`, `git push`, code refactors of
  non-test files, build successes, or release pipelines. The policy is
  "explicit only" with the single Author-verify exception
  (`harness/knowledge/test-runner/unit-test-policy.md`).
- Does **not** auto-run LLM-smoke tests even in Author-verify mode —
  always asks the user first when the new test touches an on-device LLM
  path.
- Does **not** widen Author-verify scope. If the user wants more, they
  invoke Scoped or Full explicitly.
- Does **not** audit test landscape structure / boundary integrity /
  coverage gaps — that is `test-sentinel`'s job, and Sentinel does
  *not* execute tests. Two roles, separate concerns.
- Does **not** decide whether a test failure should block a release.
  The user, looking at this log, decides.

## Coordination

- **`test-sentinel`** (structural audit) — may *cite* recent test-runner
  logs to argue "the suite is green / has been green for N runs", but
  must not invoke `dotnet test` itself.
- **`build-doctor`** (build pipeline audit) — runs `dotnet build` only.
  Tests are out of its scope by policy.
- **`release-build-pipeline`** engine — does NOT include a test phase.
  If the user wants tests before release they invoke "전체 유닛테스트
  수행해" themselves; the gate is `security-guard`.

## Evaluation rubric

| Axis | Measure | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger discipline | Did the run only happen because the user asked, OR because Author-verify legitimately fired (new test in task, non-LLM or user-approved LLM)? | Pass/Fail |
| Scope accuracy (Scoped + Author-verify) | Filter correctly hit the changed/new classes (no false negatives, minimal false positives) | A/B/C/D |
| Author-verify narrowness | Author-verify fired at most once per task and stayed scoped to ONLY the new test class/method | Pass/Fail |
| LLM-smoke guard | If the new test touched on-device LLM, asked user before running | Pass/Fail |
| Test-execution hygiene | Followed `dotnet-test-execution.md` canon; testhost cleared; no parallel calls | Pass/Fail |
| Log completeness | `reason`, `scope`, `result` filled; future reader can audit *why* | A/B/C/D |
| History query usefulness | Trends + actionable patterns surfaced (not just a list) | A/B/C/D |
